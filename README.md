Pairing Is Caring
=================
A scheduling app for DevBootcamp Chicago where students can sign up to mentor one another outside of core hours.


#What is this?
Pairing Is Caring is a core philosophy of Dev Bootcamp, where I was a student from January to March 2014. During my time there,
students set up weekend pairing sessions with each other using a whiteboard with electrical tape on it that served as
a grid. It occured to several of us that this is kind of silly, since we are a school of aspiring web developers. For my
project at the end of phase two I decided to create Pairing is Caring, a scheduling app for students to make appointments
to pair with and mentor one another.

#What happened to the project?
Pairing is Caring is a good start, but does not mimic the grid structure of our pairing whiteboard. This project eventually
evolved into Shoelace, a collaborative project between Alyssa Diaz, Andrew Wittrock, and me. The new project can be found
at https://github.com/alycit/shoelace.

#Other Work:
Other projects I've worked on include [trUism](https://github.com/devdame/DBC-final-project), [Dev Overflow - RecoMemDo](https://github.com/alexcodreanu86/dev_overflow_dev), and [Survey the Foxes, Uncaged!](https://github.com/nealcpeters/survey_gorilla).
